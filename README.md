# Prime Number Multiplication Table

This program creates a multiplication table of the first N primes.

To find the first N primes, I used the [AKS Primality Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test)


## To run this program

The multiply program was written in go. This repository contains a
compiled binary, so there is no need to have go installed. Just run:
`./multiply`

This will run the program with a default N of 10. To run the program
with a custom N, run:
`./multiply <a positive int>`
